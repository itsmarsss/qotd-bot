# QOTD-Bot
Simple Question Of The Day (QOTD) Discord Bot you can add to your server. 
## What is this bot for?
QOTD stands for Question Of The Day and is usually used to keep servers active and members talking.
## What does it do?
This bot allows for daily (or custom timed) QOTD to be sent in a specific channel. It allows users to add their own QOTD to the bot's queue, and QOTD managers to manage the queue.
## How to set it up?
Simply follow a tutorial to create a Discord bot and run the code. Pass in the bot's token and configure the bot through the commands in `qotd help`.
## Restrictions?
1. The bot will only work on one server
2. The QOTD queue is stored in ram, meaning it will all be cleared once the program stops
3. The bot must be self-hosted
